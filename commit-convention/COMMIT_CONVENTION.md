# Commit Convention

## How to work with a project

### As a repository maintainer

__New update__

1. clone a project from a repository to local workspace;
2. create a new branch for an update;
3. complete the update;
4. perform a Code Review;
5. merge your branch with `master`;
6. delete your branch.

__Notes__

1. always delete development branches;
2. always push squashed commit to `master`.

### As a contributor

1. clone a project from a repository to local workspace;
2. create a new branch for an update;
3. complete the update;
4. perform a Code Review;
5. create a Pull Request to the original repository.

## Merge all dev branches in master

__IDEA__

1. checkout `master` branch;
2. select `VCS` in menu;
3. select `Git`;
4. select `Merge changes`;
5. check `Squash commit`;
6. click on `Merge`.

## Branches

__In projects using next types of branches:__

* `master` - master branch. Contains a production version of the project. Don't push working changes to `master`!
* `feature/version` - branch for a feature. Use for updates or fixes which are in developing. Can be named as project version.

## Commit message
